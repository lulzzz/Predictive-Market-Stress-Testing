# Predictive Market Stress Testing

In this developer journey, we will use three Bluemix finance services to create a web application which performs stress test on an investment portfolio. The Investment Portfolio service is used to load the portfolio into the interface. The Predictive Market Scenario service will generate a scenario csv using the risk factor and shock magnitude provided by the user. The Simulated Instrument Analytics service uses scenario csv with each holding in the portfolio to create a table displaying the current and stressed value of the investment holding.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Load and retrieve data from the Investment Portfolio service
* Use the Predictive Market Scenario service to generate a scenario
* Send data along with a scenario to the Simulated Instrument Analytics service to retrieve analytics

## Included Components
+ Bluemix Investment Portfolio
+ Bluemix Predictive Market Scenario
+ Bluemix Simulated Instrument Analytics

# Deploy to Bluemix

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.com/raheelzubairy/Predictive-Market-Stress-Testing)

Be sure to [load investment profile](#3-load-investment-portfolio) before running the application.

# Running the Application
Follow these steps to setup and run this developer journey. The steps are described in detail below.

## Prerequisite
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)

## Steps
1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Bluemix services](#2-create-bluemix-services)
3. [Load Investment Portfolio](#3-load-investment-portfolio)
4. [Configure Manifest file](#4-configure-manifest)
5. [Configure .env file](#5-configure-env-file)
6. [Run Application](#6-run-application)

## 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `Predictive-Market-Stress-Testing code` locally. In a terminal, run:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/raheelzubairy/Predictive-Market-Stress-Testing.git`


## 2. Create Bluemix services

Create the following services:

* [**Investment Portfolio**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/investment-portfolio)
* [**Predictive Market Scenario**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/predictive-market-scenarios)
* [**Simulated Instrument Analytics**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/simulated-instrument-analytics)


## 3. Load Investment Portfolio

You can load your Investment Portfolio using curl.
For all these steps:
- replace {service-user-id} the user id associated with your Investment Portfolio Service
- replace {service-user_password} with the password associated with your Investment Portfolio Service

i. Creating a portfolio entry in your Portfolio Investment Service:

`curl -X POST -u "{service-user-id}":"{service-user_password}" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{ "name":"Portfolio1", "timestamp": "2017-02-22T19:53:56.830Z", "closed": false, "data": { "manager": "Will Smith" }}' 'https://investment-portfolio.mybluemix.net/api/v1/portfolios'`

ii. Creating holdings in your entry:

`curl -X POST -u "{service-user-id}":"{service-user_password}" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept:application/json' -d '{ "timestamp": "2017-05-02T19:53:56.830Z", "holdings": [ { "asset": "AMGN", "quantity": 1000, "instrumentId": "CX_US031162BG42_USD"}, { "asset": "APC", "quantity": 3000, "instrumentId": "CX_US032511BM81_USD" }, { "asset": "ABIBB", "quantity": 2500, "instrumentId": "CX_US035242AJ52_USD" } ] }' 'https://investment-portfolio.mybluemix.net/api/v1/portfolios/Portfolio1/holdings'`

Find more information on Investment Portfolio api calls [here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/apidocs/751-investment-portfolio?&language=node#introduction).

## 4. Configure Manifest file

Edit the `manifest.yml` file in the folder that contains your code and replace with a unique name for your application. The name that you specify determines the application's URL, such as `your-application-name.mybluemix.net`. Additionally - update the service names so they match what you have in Bluemix. The relevant portion of the `manifest.yml` file looks like the following:

  ```none
  declared-services:
    Investment-Portfolio:
      label: fss-portfolio-service
      plan: fss-portfolio-service-free-plan
    Predictive-Market-Scenarios:
      label: fss-predictive-scenario-analytics-service
      plan: fss-predictive-scenario-analytics-service-free-plan
    Simulated-Instrument-Analytics:
      label: fss-scenario-analytics-service
      plan: fss-scenario-analytics-service-free-plan
  applications:
  - path: .
    memory: 128M
    instances: 1
    name: Predictive-Market-Stress-Testing
    disk_quota: 1024M
    domain: mybluemix.net
    services:
    - Investment-Portfolio
    - Predictive-Market-Scenarios
    - Simulated-Instrument-Analytics
    buildpack: python_buildpack
  ```

## 5. Configure .env file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your clone of the project repository by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command:

  ```none
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  **NOTE** Most files systems regard files with a "." at the front as hidden files.  If you are on a Windows system, you should be able to use either [GitBash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or [Xcopy](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/xcopy.mspx?mfr=true)

You will need to update the credentials with the Bluemix credentials for each of the services you created in [Step 2](#2-create-bluemix-services).

The `.env` file will look something like the following:

  ```none
  #Investment Portfolio
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_USERID_W=
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_PWD_W=
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_USERID_R=
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_PWD_R=
  URL_GET_PORTFOLIO_HOLDINGS=https://investment-portfolio.mybluemix.net/api/v1/portfolios/

  #Predictive Market Scenario
  CRED_PREDICTIVE_MARKET_SCENARIO_URL=https://fss-analytics.mybluemix.net/api/v1/scenario/generate_predictive
  CRED_PREDICTIVE_MARKET_SCENARIO_ACCESSTOKEN=

  #Simulated Instrument Analytics
  CRED_SIMULATED_INSTRUMENT_ANALYTICS_URL=https://fss-analytics.mybluemix.net/api/v1/scenario/instrument/
  CRED_SIMULATED_INSTRUMENT_ANALYTICS_ACCESSTOKEN=
  ```

## 6. Run Application

cd into this project's root directory
+ Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the app's dependencies
+ Run `python run.py`
+ Access the running app in a browser at <http://localhost:5000>

# Troubleshooting

* To troubleshoot your Bluemix application, use the logs. To see the logs, run:

```bash
cf logs <application-name> --recent
```

* If you are running locally - inspect your environment variables closely to confirm they match.  Try running each service as standalone:

```bash
python InvestmentPortfolio.py
python PredictiveMarketScenario.py
python SimulatedInstrumentAnalytics.py
```
